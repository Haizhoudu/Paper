\section{conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
\par In this paper, Hummingbird: a novel approach of finding optimal configurations for big data analytics is proposed, and Hummingbird  based on PSO  is established.  Experimental results show that Hummingbird has good accuracy and computational performance across diverse workloads for Wordcount and Sort. And experimental results also show that Hummingbird is effective and available to tune the configuration parameters of Spark platform. An average of 28\% performance improvement can be got with the proposed method. Moreover, with the increase of input data, the effect of performance improvement is more obvious.
\par At the same time, the proposed approach is more robust and flexible as it is easier to adapt to changes. Experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to build an effective performance for big data analytics system in a black box manner, that is, in manner of only using observations from the system and without getting its internals.
\par In the future, we will conduct further research on parameters selection in order to select more suitable parameters. And, we will also consider more parameters affecting on the performance,  try to cover all of spark parameters.
